# üõí Strategic Superstore Sales & Profitability Dashboard

## üåü Project Overview
This project delivers a **Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** built in **Microsoft Power BI**, using the widely adopted [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).  

The dashboard empowers senior management with **actionable insights** into sales, profitability, and customer behavior. It provides clarity on **market expansion opportunities**, **product portfolio optimization**, and **customer segmentation** strategies.  

The solution consists of three interconnected views:
- **Superstore Overview** ‚Äì High-level KPIs and executive summary.  
- **Market Analysis** ‚Äì Regional and sub-regional performance tracking.  
- **Product Analysis** ‚Äì Sales and profitability across categories and sub-categories.

## üéØ Business Objectives
This dashboard addresses the most pressing questions for decision-makers:

1. **Which regions and sub-regions deliver the highest profitability and growth potential?**  
   - Identify areas with the strongest YoY growth vs. underperforming markets.  

2. **Which product categories and sub-categories are driving sales vs. profitability?**  
   - Evaluate whether discount-heavy categories erode margins.  

3. **Where are sales or profits lagging, and what are the contributing factors?**  
   - Pinpoint underperforming regions, customer segments, or products.  

4. **How are performance metrics trending over time?**  
   - Track YoY changes in sales and profitability to assess long-term momentum.

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Analysis

| **KPI**                  | **Business Significance**                                                           | **Calculation / Definition**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Sales**           | Measures overall revenue generated across all transactions.                         | `SUM(Sales)`                                                                                 |
| **Total Profit**          | Assesses financial gains after costs are deducted.                                  | `SUM(Profit)`                                                                                |
| **Profit Margin %**       | Evaluates profitability efficiency by comparing profit to sales.                    | `(Total Profit √∑ Total Sales) √ó 100`                                                         |
| **YoY Sales Growth %**    | Tracks business momentum and highlights growth/decline patterns year-over-year.     | `((Sales Current Year - Sales Previous Year) √∑ Sales Previous Year) √ó 100`                   |
| **% Profit Lost**         | Shows inefficiency due to discounts or operational issues.                          | `(Profit Lost √∑ Total Potential Profit) √ó 100`                                               |
| **% Sales Lost**          | Highlights lost revenue opportunities (returns, stockouts, excessive discounts).    | `(Sales Lost √∑ Total Potential Sales) √ó 100`                                                 |
